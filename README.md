# Automapy

This really short script automates searching Google Maps by letting the user enter the address and city of his desired location and then it automatically opens the browser, goes to google maps and displays results of entered location to the user.

### Required packages

1. `pyperclip` module for copying the address from clipboard if user presses enter.

`$ pip3 install pyperclip`

OR go to [pyperclip](https://pypi.org/project/pyperclip/#files) and download it from there.


### Running the script
Give permissions to `gmaps.py` and run it:

```sh
$ chmod +x gmaps.py
$ ./gmaps.py
```

### 2nd way

```sh
$ python3 gmaps.py
```
